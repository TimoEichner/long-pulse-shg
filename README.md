# long-pulse-shg

Python module for simulating second harmonic generation with nanosecond laser pulses. 

The code calculates the evolution of the 3-dimensional field amplitude (A(x,y,t)) of the fundamental and second harmonic pulses by solving the coupled differential equations of SHG and linear propagation of both pulses.
