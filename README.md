# long-pulse-shg

Python module for simulating second harmonic generation with nanosecond laser pulses. 

The code calculates the evolution of the 3-dimensional field amplitude (A(x,y,t)) of monochromatic fundamental and second harmonic pulses by solving the nonlinear and linear propagation of the pulses using a split-step Fourier approach.

See example.ipynb for example usage.
